  2012 was one of those films that really left a lasting impression on
  me, especially as my first proper disaster movie. The visual effects
  were absolutely mind-blowingâ€”like, the earthquakes, tsunamis, and
  volcanic eruptions were on a whole other level. It was intense and
  kept me hooked the entire time, but what stood out was how it balanced
  the chaos with genuine emotional depth. Sure, some parts were a bit over-the-top,
  but the focus on family, human resilience, and even the environmental message gave
  it a bit of substance. Looking back, it might not be the most realistic film out
  there, but at the time, it was an absolute standout. Definitely one of those movies
  that sticks with you, even if itâ€™s a bit over-the-top in places.

<h3>MOVIE:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedevilled_(2010_film)"> Bedevilled</a> </h3>

  Bedevilled is one of those films that stays with you long after itâ€™s over.
  Itâ€™s not just about the violenceâ€”though thereâ€™s plenty of thatâ€”but more about
  the emotional weight behind it. Seo Young-heeâ€™s portrayal of Kim Bok-nam is
  heartbreaking; you can feel her desperation and pain as she endures years of
  abuse on that isolated island. The setting itself is almost a character,
  with its eerie beauty contrasting sharply with the ugliness of the story. What
  really got to me was how the film explores themes of complicity and the ways
  people turn a blind eye to suffering. Itâ€™s heavy and hard to watch at times,
  but itâ€™s also incredibly powerful and thought-provoking. Definitely a film that
  makes you reflect on deeper issues.

<h3>MOVIE:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drishyam_(2015_film)"> Drishyam</a> </h3>

<p style="max-width: 600px; text-align: justify; margin: 0 auto;">
  Drishyam is a really solid thriller that keeps you hooked. Ajay Devgn plays Vijay,
  a regular guy who does whatever it takes to protect his family after they get
  caught up in a crime. The story is full of clever twists, and Tabu, as the tough
  cop, adds a lot of tension. What I liked most is how itâ€™s not just about the
  suspenseâ€”it also makes you think about right and wrong, and how far youâ€™d go for
  your family. The setting feels real, and the emotions hit hard. Itâ€™s a smart,
  engaging film thatâ€™s definitely worth watching.
